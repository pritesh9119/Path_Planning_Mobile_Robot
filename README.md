# Explanation for Block 1:
Desired Position Coordinates:

x_d = 5; y_d = 3;: The robot aims to reach the point (5, 3).
Gains for Control:

Kv = 0.5;: Proportional gain for controlling the velocity.
Kh = 1;: Proportional gain for controlling the steering angle.
Distance Calculation:

distance = sqrt((x_d - x)^2 + (y_d - y)^2);: The Euclidean distance from the current position to the desired position.
Velocity Input Calculation:

v = Kv * distance;: The velocity is proportional to the distance to the target, modulated by the gain Kv.
Desired Orientation Calculation:

Theta_d = atan2(y_d - y, x_d - x);: The desired orientation angle is calculated using atan2, which correctly handles the calculation in all quadrants and avoids division by zero.
Steering Angle Calculation:

gamma = Kh * (Theta_d - Theta);: The steering angle is proportional to the difference between the desired orientation angle and the current orientation, modulated by the gain Kh.
This function is useful for simple navigation tasks where the robot needs to move towards a fixed goal position with appropriate velocity and steering adjustments based on its current state.



# Explanation for Black2:
Function Declaration and Documentation:

function [dx, dy, dtheta] = fcn(v, gamma, theta): Declares the function fcn with inputs v, gamma, and theta, and outputs dx, dy, and dtheta.
The comments at the beginning provide a brief description of the function, its inputs, and its outputs.
Wheelbase of the Robot:

L = 2;: Sets the wheelbase of the robot, which is the distance between the front and rear axles. This is a constant value used in the calculation of the change in orientation.
Change in Position Calculation:

dx = v * cos(theta);: Calculates the change in the x-coordinate based on the velocity and the current orientation.
dy = v * sin(theta);: Calculates the change in the y-coordinate based on the velocity and the current orientation.
Change in Orientation Calculation:

dtheta = (v / L) * tan(gamma);: Calculates the change in the orientation based on the velocity, the wheelbase, and the steering angle. The use of tan(gamma) accounts for the steering angle's effect on the turning radius of the robot.
This function models the kinematic behavior of a mobile robot, allowing for simulation and analysis of its movement based on given control inputs (velocity and steering angle) and its current orientation.
